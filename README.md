# Backing up service for kt-vertx-wiki

Service done to study Kotlin + Vertx combo in microservices architecture. It's supposed to be 'cold storage' for the kt-vertx-wiki which saves the files as raw files on disk and allows some methods to retrieve them.

Neither is this really useful software, but done as a learning experience.
